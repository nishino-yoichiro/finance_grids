# Financial Bento Grids

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

The Financial Bento Grids project is designed to display trade history in an interactive Bento grid format. The backend script `retrieval.py` fetches the necessary trading data, and the frontend, built with React, presents this data in a user-friendly grid interface. This allows users to easily view and analyze their trading activities.


## Setup Instructions

To set up the backend for data retrieval and start the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Run the backend setup script**:
   ```bash
   python retrieval.py

2. **Run the frontend script**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
